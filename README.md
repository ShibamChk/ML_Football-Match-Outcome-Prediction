This is an undergraduate course project which I have done. Here I have used a dataset which has the football scores from 1882 to today. You can find this dataset through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patateriedata/all-international-football-results
In this project I have predicted the home team match outcomes, using three classification models. Why have I used classification? Because I am prediciting Binary outputs, as an example, win or loses and draw.
